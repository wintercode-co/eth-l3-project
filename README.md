# L3 Project
happy hacking

This repo aspires to hold an SDK which can be used to spinning up L3 applications on top of a zkEVM rollup. We'd like the user experience nad convenience of something like Cosmos SDK, but on top of zkEVM rollups like Polygon zkEVM and Scroll.

Currently, it is mostly placeholder holder and setup, so there is work to be done.

## main.go
Contains some startup code for connecting to the Polygon zkEVM test net, and interacting with a demo contract. For now, that is Store.sol (this does nothing of value, it's just a demo contract). Rollup.sol could be a useful template, but we may not need it now.
